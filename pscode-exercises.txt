To complete this assignment, I used Python commands, as it is the language I will be using in the data science path in Code Louisville.

To begin this assignment, I used Excel commands to create a draft pseudocode. I did this because I am familiar with Excel commands. Then I reviewed each Excel command for a parity command in Python. I used ChatGPT to help create responses to the exercises, and checked my understanding each time I used ChatGPT for help to ensure that I understood the logic of the commands.

I do not pretented to know these commands by heart for a live coding situation, but I do understand the logic of Python and will work to commit the language to memory as I go through Code Louisville.

I then used my knowledge of Git to add, commit, and push the .txt file to my repo


// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

sum = num1 + num2

print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", sum)
 

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd


number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if number % 2 == 0:
    print(number, "is even.")
else:
    print(number, "is odd.")

 

// Exercise 3: Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

 

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   

numbers = [n1,n2,n3,n4,n5]

for i in range(5):
    num = float(input("Enter number {}: ".format(i+1)))
    numbers.append(num) 

print("The numbers you entered are:", numbers)

 

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

numbers = [n1,n2,n3,n4,n5]

for i in range(5):
    num = float(input("Enter number {}: ".format(i+1)))
    numbers.append(num)

total_sum = sum(numbers)
average = total_sum / len(numbers)

print("The average of the numbers is:", average)

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

numbers = [n1,n2,n3,n4,n5]

# Loop to read in 5 numbers
for i in range(5):
    num = float(input("Enter number {}: ".format(i+1)))
    numbers.append(num)

smallest = min(numbers)
largest = max(numbers)

print("The smallest number is:", smallest)
print("The largest number is:", largest)

 
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Letter b)'s code calculates the sum of five discrete numbers then divides them by five to determine the average (average = sum of numbers / total count of numbers). One must create a list of numbers then use a loop variable (i) to iterate across the sequence of values and add the number to the list. The command then calculates the value and creates the answer ("print").

Letter c)'s code designates a particular number in an iterative series as smallest or largest. The code compares a single number in a series of numbers (n#) to each other number in the series (n#). The codes min(numbers) and max(numbers) define their respective greater or less than integers and call the results ("print")
